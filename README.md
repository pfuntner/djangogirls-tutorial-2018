I'm going through the [Djangogirl Tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/) creating a small web app for posts.  

* Initially, I successfully opened the app from my Windows workstation and, as per the instructions, put the files here on Git in preparation for deployment to [Python Anywhere!](https://www.pythonanywhere.com)
* Since I started, I've continued to follow the tutorial, using my local files as sort of a staging area to get things working.  Like a regular development process, I've been pushing changes to Git when I was happy and pulling them on PythonAnywhere to get the changes deployed there

##### 2023 update
I originally created this by going through a tutorial in 2018 around the time I was learning to use Django for a work project.  I really enjoyed using Django but didn't have a need to use it after I left that role.  Since then, I've forgoten a lot of details but would like to pick it back up, maybe through a new tutorial.  I might start a new repository.

I think I'm going to archive this repo too.  I've never really done that and wonder if there's a way of going back but that's another opportunity for learning. ðŸ˜º
